Re write this with no jargon. organize the examples. and the process. It should be able to be completed by a 6th grader. It should be written as a facilitator guide. It is the facilitator's job to provide the physical motion for the "instructors" to teach their students. Students role is to be compliant with directions. This could be further extended by providing a list of responses that the student could demonstrate for the instructor to address.


Goals for Snow Sport Lesson:
It's important not to get focused on a specific goal within lessons. These.end up resulting in.a too rigid of an approach.and at times might result in a loss of connection or rapport withthe student.It's more important to.have a connection and maintain a connection that is the priority.as opposed to being overly goal oriented.

When working with the learner they will.tell you if they don't like the instruction that you provided, they'll demonstrate in our multitude of different ways either.through behavioror not interested or just verbally telling youthat happens perhaps if you're pushing a goal too far that isn't their goal again.focusing on connection.ultimately the goal of the lesson is to bring them into the culture of snow sports.And while there is a degree of gold settingyou can guide and support the individual in thatyou need to be reflexive to their needs.Ultimately, a lesson can only go so far andanyways.related to performanceor skill setultimately is between you and the snowA key concept within a lesson is foreshadowing.This is a process where you describe the activities.throughout the process, you're essentially telling them what's going to happen before you do it.In some way, it's laying out the framework for the rest of the time together.at the begin it's good to assess their goals, but also to check in on communication andfor example, knowing what words to use and if they understand the wordsand essentially assessing theattributes identified above.

Sometimes it'll be difficult to tell if a child is enjoying the lesson or not, because they may be.silent, recluse, quiet.But then after the lesson you receive feedback from the family that they couldn't stop talking about the lesson and can't wait to go back for another one.The ultimate measure on the success of a lesson is if the individual returns to the sport.and if they keep coming back.setting up recurring lessons and essentially building a client.is an aspirational goalin there has been some benefit to instructors and to the organization forhaving recurringstudents come receive lessons.

Reorganie this and summarize. "Between you and the snow" should be quoted to Lance. This should be the conclusion. Tied in with the ultimate goal from the beginning of brining people into the culture of snow sports.

Three Blind Snow Mice Activity
During this activityall instructors actively participated.One group was a group of four, which.was utilized for.demonstration purposes across the entire training.Lance provided verbal prompting in encouragement to supportalternative communication styles.The fluency at whichinstructorswere able to communicateacrossmultiple trials.appeared to increaseas instructors became more familiar and comfortable with using the restrictions put in place by the activity to teach the skill.

Break: Brief 7 minute break for hot chocolate and cookies. 

Lesson: Structure and Flow

Lance provide an engaging lecture.with the highlight being focusing on connection.in accommodating the learner needs discussed during the previous session lesson and alsothrough the group activity.Landscape of particular good example of playing in a head or foreshadowing in which he demonstrated what it would sound like to Verbalize to a student what the plan for the activity was.areas to consider for how to approach the lesson through assessing student interestand capacity with consideration of family dynamics and othercultural considerationsbut ultimatelyit was instilled that our goal is to keep them coming back.
